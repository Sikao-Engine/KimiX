"""Builtin ``kimix_api`` skill renders exactly like ``skill-creator``.

``kimix_api`` (``kimi-cli/src/kimi_cli/skills/kimix_api/SKILL.md``) is shipped as a
builtin skill alongside ``skill-creator``. Because the builtin skills root is always
a discovery root, ``kimix_api`` is discovered from any working directory and rendered
by the same ``format_skills_for_prompt`` path as ``skill-creator`` — real frontmatter
description and absolute path — so the two entries in the system prompt have an
identical shape.
