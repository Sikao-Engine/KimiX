"""Always-on context-usage telemetry for agent self-regulation.

Research shows agents manage memory better when context pressure is
*observable*: a cheap status line lets the model pick a good moment to
checkpoint, recall history, or start a fresh session — instead of the
harness compacting at a bad time.

This provider injects a context-usage status reminder when usage has
materially changed, nudging the model to checkpoint important facts before
the harness compacts. It deliberately stays quiet in the high-usage
region, which is owned by :class:`CompactReminderProvider`
(actionable advice), so the two never double-inject.
