"""Context-overflow detection and per-step recovery budget (Phase 4 §6.1).

Port of DSH's ``agent/request-error`` + ``{kind:'retry'}`` recovery loop: when a
provider confirms the context window was exceeded (a 4xx ``APIStatusError`` whose
message matches the overflow markers), the soul force-compacts and re-runs the
step instead of immediately interrupting the session with
``SessionRestartRequired``.

``classify_api_error`` (kimisoul.py) already returns ``"context_overflow"`` for
these errors; the marker list lives here so both paths share one source of truth
(importing from kimisoul would create a circular import).
