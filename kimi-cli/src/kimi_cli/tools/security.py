"""Shared security primitives for tool execution (pure, import-cycle safe).

This module is the single home for three helpers that the shell family and
the Python tool both rely on:

- :func:`scrub_child_env` — build a child-process environment that cannot
  leak credentials from the parent environment.
- :func:`redact_sensitive_output` — mask credentials (JWT, PEM keys, API
  tokens, auth headers, URL userinfo, ``password=`` assignments) so secrets
  never reach the model or the export pipeline.
- :func:`validate_workdir` — reject control characters and shell
  metacharacters in a user-supplied working directory.

The pure-Python algorithm for each helper lives once, in the canonical
``kimix_native.tools`` shim (``_compat_*`` fallbacks).  This module keeps the
public API and the native fast-path dispatch and delegates the pure-Python
fallback to the shim, so there is exactly one copy of each algorithm.
