"""Shrink oversized images before they reach the model.

A multimodal request carries each image as a base64 data URL; an unbounded
screenshot or photo wastes context tokens and can blow past the provider's
per-image byte ceiling. This module downsamples and re-encodes such images
so they fit a pixel + byte budget, while leaving already-small images
untouched — the common case is a fast, codec-free pass-through.

Design notes:
- Pillow is the codec, imported lazily inside the functions that need it so
  startup and the fast path stay cheap (mirrors the TS lazy codec loading).
- Best effort: any decode/encode failure of :func:`compress_image_for_model`
  returns the original bytes unchanged (``changed=False``). Callers must
  verify that this unchanged result satisfies their delivery limits before
  forwarding it.
- PNG, JPEG, and (non-animated) WebP are re-encoded. GIF and animated WebP
  are passed through to preserve animation. Formats outside the
  provider-accepted set (see :mod:`kimi_cli.utils.image_format_policy`) are
  never forwarded by the tool — callers gate on
  ``is_model_accepted_image_mime`` first.
- Compression must never be silent to the model: results carry the original
  dimensions, and :func:`crop_image_for_model` lets a caller read a region
  of the original back at full fidelity.

Ported from ``packages/agent-core/src/tools/support/image-compress.ts`` and
the ``sniffImageDimensions`` part of ``.../support/file-type.ts`` in the Kimi
Code TypeScript monorepo. The TS module's telemetry events have no
Python-side equivalent and are not ported.

    Strategy — prefer the source format so a downscaled screenshot stays

    lossy JPEG when PNG cannot meet the byte budget:
    - PNG source: PNG at the fitted size -> smaller PNG rescales down to
      the PNG_RESCALE_FLOOR_PX floor -> JPEG ladder at that size -> JPEG
      ladder again at each sub-floor edge.
    - JPEG source: the full quality ladder at the fitted size, then again
      at each fallback edge — a smaller rescale must not skip the
      high-quality rungs its extra pixels just paid for.

    The sub-floor edges make the ladder converge for small (read-scale)
    budgets: any budget of a few tens of KB is met by q20 at 256px even
    for entropy-upper-bound content. Below that, the smallest buffer
    produced is still returned — the caller gates on whether it actually
