"""Windows Git Bash compatibility fixes for selected native POSIX commands.

Git for Windows ships a substantial POSIX userland, but a few command names
commonly emitted for Linux or macOS are absent even though an equivalent is
already available.  This module rewrites only verified, behaviorally compatible
command words.  It does not install software and deliberately leaves commands
without a faithful equivalent untouched.

Windows-style backslash paths (``D:\\repo\\src``, ``\\\\server\\share``,
``~\\Desktop``, ``.\\build``) — whether used as arguments, redirection targets,
or as the command word itself (``C:\\tools\\rg.exe``) — are rewritten to the
forward-slash spellings Git Bash understands, and the cmd.exe-only
``cd /d <path>`` form loses its flag
(``cd`` accepts a single argument in Bash).  Git Bash virtual POSIX absolute
paths are rewritten to the native spellings native Windows executables can
resolve: ``/tmp/x`` becomes the real Windows temp directory (``/tmp`` in Git
Bash is a virtual mount, so a native tool would otherwise read it as
``<current-drive>:\\tmp\\x``) and ``/c/x``/``/d/x`` become ``C:/x``/``D:/x``.
This makes a POSIX-style command behave the same under Git Bash and native
POSIX bash.  A redundant leading shell
invocation — ``bash cd /c/dev/x && ...`` or ``bash -c 'cd C:\\x && rev'`` —
is unwrapped (and the ``-c`` inline script is scanned for fallbacks and
paths) because the Bash tool already runs the whole string via bash, so
``bash cd ...`` would otherwise try to open ``cd`` as a script file and fail.
Under an active command wrapper (``env``/``nohup``/``timeout``/...) the shell
word is an operand of that wrapper, so ``bash -c '<script>'`` keeps its shape
and only the inline script is fixed in place.

Command wrappers whose operand is itself a command are scanned as command
contexts so missing POSIX commands behind them get their Git Bash fallback:
``timeout`` (its one DURATION operand is consumed first), ``stdbuf``, ``nice``,
and ``xargs`` (bundled Git Bash executables that exec their operand), plus the
fallback wrappers ``gtimeout`` and ``watch`` (which also record their own
fallback definition; ``watch`` re-runs its command through ``eval "$*"`` in
the same shell, matching procps ``watch``'s ``sh -c`` behavior).  Fallback
definitions are exported (``export -f``) so nested shells — the standalone
runner scripts and ``bash -c`` operands — inherit them.

Rewrites are conservative: the
unquoted word must look unambiguously like a Windows path, so quoted data,
tool-level escape sequences, short ambiguous words such as ``a\\nb``, and
single-segment relative paths such as ``foo\\bar`` are preserved byte-for-byte.
Words whose normalized form needs it (spaces, ``&``, ``;``, ...) are emitted
inside double quotes; glob metacharacters stay unquoted so ``D:/x/*.txt`` still
performs pathname expansion.

The scanner is shell-aware: quoted text, comments, heredoc and here-string
bodies, assignments, case patterns, and ordinary arguments are data, not
commands.  Nested command substitutions and process substitutions are scanned
as their own command contexts.

The scanner implementation is the canonical pure-Python reference that lives
in ``bin/kimix_native/_shell_compat.py`` (the ``kimix_native`` shim); this
module keeps only the public API and the Windows-platform gate, so the
scanner logic exists in exactly one place.
