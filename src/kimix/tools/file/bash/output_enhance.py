"""Output-side enhancements for the shell tool family.

Pure functions only: no tool imports (import-cycle safe).

Provides:

- :func:`interpret_exit_code` — explain what a non-zero exit code means for
  well-known commands (grep "no matches" is normal, etc.).
- :func:`is_expected_exit` — decide whether a non-zero exit code is the normal,
  expected outcome for a command (grep "no matches", diff "files differ", a
  truncated pipeline), so shell tools report it as an informative success
  instead of a hard failure with retry guidance.
- :func:`annotate_failure` — a single actionable hint for common failure
  signatures in command output (command not found, missing file, missing
  Python module, permission denied).
- :func:`redact_sensitive_output` — mask credentials (JWT, PEM keys, API
  tokens, auth headers, URL userinfo, ``password=`` assignments) so secrets
  never reach the model or the export pipeline.  The implementation moved to
  :mod:`kimix.tools.security`; this module re-exports it for compatibility.

The pure-Python algorithm for each function lives once, in the canonical
``kimix_native.tools`` shim (``_compat_*`` fallbacks).  This module keeps the
public API and the native fast-path dispatch and delegates the pure-Python
fallback to the shim.
